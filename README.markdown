Object-oriented inheritance in JavaScript
=========================================

Used to traditional object-oriented languages, I found JavaScript's
prototype-based inheritance confusing. Also I hated to repeatedly
type the four-step JavaScript procedure for inheritance. We have
computers for this! So I wrote this small utility function, which
derives a subclass in one step and avoids polluting the *prototype*
with instance variables of the parent class.
